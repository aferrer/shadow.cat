<p>[suggested title: ``The Moose is Flying (part 2)'']</p>
<p>Last month, I introduced the <code>Moose</code> object system by walking through
the code developed in the <em>perlboot</em> manpage, rewriting it to use
Moose.  Continuing from that discussion, let's look at some of the
features I didn't cover last month.</p>
<p>Our <code>Animal</code> role included attributes of <code>name</code>, and <code>color</code>,
and actions of <code>speak</code> and <code>eat</code>.  We can add a birthdate attribute
to the mix with:</p>
<pre>
  has 'born' =&gt; (is =&gt; 'ro');</pre>
<p>As we don't want to be able to change the birthdate, we'll make it
read-only.  By default, this attribute accepts any scalar, so these
are all equally valid:</p>
<pre>
  my $horse = Horse-&gt;new(born =&gt; 'yesterday', name =&gt; 'Newbie');
  my $cow = Cow-&gt;new(born =&gt; 'spring of 82', name =&gt; 'Bessie');
  my $mouse = Mouse-&gt;new(name =&gt; 'Minnie', born =&gt; '3/14/1929');
  my $racehorse = RaceHorse-&gt;new(name =&gt; 'Slew', born =&gt; [3, 5, 59]);</pre>
<p>We can get a bit of help from Moose to narrow down the permissible
type of this new birthdate attribute using Moose's typing system:</p>
<pre>
  require DateTime;
  has 'born' =&gt; (is =&gt; 'ro', isa =&gt; 'DateTime');</pre>
<p>The <code>isa</code> parameter here declares that the <code>born</code> parameter must be
a DateTime object, or at least something that responds true to
<code>UNIVERSAL::isa($thing, &quot;DateTime&quot;)</code>.</p>
<p>Now, if we try to put anything in this <code>born</code> attribute other than
a <code>DateTime</code>, we get a run-time error.  So, this fails:</p>
<pre>
  my $horse = Horse-&gt;new(born =&gt; 'yesterday', name =&gt; 'Newbie');</pre>
<p>But this succeeds:</p>
<pre>
  my $horse = Horse-&gt;new(born =&gt; DateTime-&gt;now, name =&gt; 'Newbie');</pre>
<p>The <code>DateTime</code> string for <code>isa</code> refers here to the Perl class.
However, we can also define this as an artificial Moose type:</p>
<pre>
  use Moose::Util::TypeConstraints;
  require DateTime;
  subtype 'DateTime'
    =&gt; as 'Object'
    =&gt; where { $_-&gt;isa('DateTime') };</pre>
<p>This works like before, but now identifies <code>DateTime</code> as a
Moose-type.  The type is created by starting with any <code>Object</code>, and
then requiring that this object pass the additional qualification of
being a subclass of Perl's <code>DateTime</code>.</p>
<p>At this point, we could continue to use this Moose-style DateTime type
as we had before.  But once we've done this, we can further subtype
the type.  For example, we can require that the date be a historical
date (before now):</p>
<pre>
  subtype 'HistoricalDateTime'
    =&gt; as 'DateTime'
    =&gt; where { $_ &lt;= DateTime-&gt;now };
  has 'born' =&gt; (is =&gt; 'ro', isa =&gt; 'HistoricalDateTime');</pre>
<p>Now, not just any DateTime will do.  It has to be something that isn't
in the future.  The expression in <code>where</code> can be any expression
returning a true/false value, using <code>$_</code> as a proxy for the object in
question.</p>
<p>It'd be easier if we could still use casual forms like <code>yesterday</code>
and <code>3/14/1929</code>.  These are both understood by <code>Date::Manip</code>.  We
could parse the strings with <code>Date::Manip</code>, then pull out the component
values and hand them to <code>DateTime</code>, but luckily, there's already
a module to do that: <code>DateTime::Format::DateManip</code>.</p>
<pre>
  use DateTime::Format::DateManip;
  my $yesterday = DateTime::Format::DateManip-&gt;parse_datetime('yesterday');
  my $newbie = Horse-&gt;new(born =&gt; $yesterday, name =&gt; 'Newbie');</pre>
<p>Not bad.  Our newbie horse is born yesterday, as we expect.  But
it'd be nice to just drop <code>yesterday</code> into the slot and have it do
all of that for us. And with <em>coercions</em>, we can.</p>
<p>Since passing a simple string as the birthtime is illegal, we can
inform Moose that it should take that string and run it through
<code>DateTime::Format::DateManip</code> automatically:</p>
<pre>
  coerce 'HistoricalDateTime'
    =&gt; from 'Str'
    =&gt; via {
      require DateTime::Format::DateManip;
      DateTime::Format::DateManip-&gt;parse_datetime($_);
    };</pre>
<p>The <code>via</code> code block takes <code>$_</code> as the input value, which is
expected to be a string (<code>Str</code>).  The last expression evaluated in
the code is the new <code>HistoricalDateTime</code> value.  We then permit this
coercion to be used by adding <code>coerce</code> into the attribute
declaration:</p>
<pre>
  has 'born' =&gt; (is =&gt; 'ro',
                 isa =&gt; 'HistoricalDateTime',
                 coerce =&gt; 1,
                );</pre>
<p>Now, the <code>born</code> slot accepts either an explicit <code>DateTime</code> as
before, or a simple string.  The string must be acceptable to
<code>Date::Manip</code>, which will be used to convert the string into a
<code>DateTime</code> object as our object is created.</p>
<pre>
  my $newbie = Horse-&gt;new(born =&gt; 'yesterday', name =&gt; 'Newbie');
  my $mouse = Mouse-&gt;new(name =&gt; 'Minnie', born =&gt; '3/14/1929');</pre>
<p>Also, because the type constraint is still in place, the verification
to ensure the result is a historical date is still active.</p>
<p>Besides the named classes and <code>Str</code>, <code>Moose::Util::TypeConstraints</code>
also establishes types of things like <code>Bool</code> and <code>HashRef</code>.</p>
<p>We could even have multiple coercions defined, as long as they are
distinct.  For example, we could use a hashref in the birthtime slot
to indicate that we are passing key/value pairs to be handed to a
<code>DateTime</code> constructor directly:</p>
<pre>
  coerce 'DateTime'
    =&gt; from 'HashRef'
    =&gt; via { DateTime-&gt;new(%$_) };</pre>
<p>And now we can use a hashref to define the birthdate:</p>
<pre>
  my $mouse = Mouse-&gt;new(
    name =&gt; 'Minnie',
    born =&gt; { month =&gt; 3, day =&gt; 14, year =&gt; 1929 },
  );</pre>
<p>If the value for <code>born</code> is a <code>DateTime</code>, it's used directly.  If
it's a string, it's passed to <code>DateTime::Format::DateManip</code>.  And if
it's a hashref, it's passed directly as a flattened list to the
<code>DateTime</code> constructor.  Very cool.</p>
<p>The value we specify for a <code>default</code> is subject to the same coercions
and type checking.  We can update <code>born</code> as:</p>
<pre>
  has 'born' =&gt; (is =&gt; 'ro',
                 isa =&gt; 'HistoricalDateTime',
                 coerce =&gt; 1,
                 default =&gt; 'yesterday',
                );</pre>
<p>And now our animals default to being ``born yesterday''.  Note that the
default value is still subject to the type constraints, so if we
replace <code>yesterday</code> with <code>tomorrow</code>, the default value will be
rejected properly.  Note that the coercion happens as each object is
created, so a default value of <code>one minute ago</code> will give us a new
time each time it is called.</p>
<p>While we're on things we can do to attributes, another interesting
item is <code>lazy</code>.  If the default value is expensive to compute, we can
say ``don't really do this until you need to do it''.  For example,
turning <code>yesterday</code> into a DateTime is slightly expensive, so we
can flag that as lazy:</p>
<pre>
  has 'born' =&gt; (is =&gt; 'ro',
                 isa =&gt; 'HistoricalDateTime',
                 coerce =&gt; 1,
                 default =&gt; 'yesterday',
                 lazy =&gt; 1,
                );</pre>
<p>Speaking of great support, as I was writing that last paragraph, I
noticed a bug in the result, and chatting with Stevan on IRC got it
fixed before I could turn this article in.  Yeay.</p>
<p>Anything built with <code>Moose</code> has a very high degree of introspection
available.  For example, we can ask one of our animal friends to give us
the <code>meta</code> object, with which we can make further requests:</p>
<pre>
  my $horse = Horse-&gt;new;
  my $meta = $horse-&gt;meta; # or equivalently, Horse-&gt;meta</pre>
<p><code>$meta</code> is a <code>Moose::Meta::Class</code>.  We can ask the horse for the
<em>roles</em>:</p>
<pre>
  my @roles = @{$meta-&gt;roles};</pre>
<p>In this case, we see that we've mixed in one role (of type <code>Moose::Meta::Role</code>,
and get the name with:</p>
<pre>
  map { $_-&gt;name } @roles; # qw(Animal)</pre>
<p>which gives us <code>Animal</code> as we might expect.  We can also ask
the meta object for all applicable methods:</p>
<pre>
  my @methods = $meta-&gt;get_method_list;</pre>
<p>which returns</p>
<pre>
  BEGIN
  born
  color
  default_color
  eat
  meta
  name
  private_set_color
  sound
  speak</pre>
<p>Nice.  Not sure what BEGIN is doing in there, but the rest are things
that we've defined.  Many of these methods relate to the attributes,
but we'd can query those definitively using
<code>compute_all_applicable_attributes</code> instead:</p>
<pre>
  my @attrs = $meta-&gt;compute_all_applicable_attributes;</pre>
<p>The result is a set of <code>Moose::Meta::Attribute</code> objects.  We can
map them through <code>name</code> as before to get the names:</p>
<pre>
  map { $_-&gt;name } @attrs; # qw(born color name)</pre>
<p>We can also see if they have setters:</p>
<pre>
  grep { $_-&gt;has_writer } @attrs; # qw(color)</pre>
<p>Note that only <code>color</code> has a setter: the other two are read-only,
so this makes sense.</p>
<p>As noted above, Moose is still being actively developed, but is
<em>production ready</em> as long as you stick with things that work.
You'll find the latest Moose in the CPAN, along with some other
core plugins, typically in the <code>MooseX</code> namespace.</p>
<p>For example, <code>MooseX::Getopt</code> allows you to define your <code>@ARGV</code> processing
using type coercion, type constraints, and all that jazz.  I haven't had time
to play with that yet, but it's on my to-do list, so perhaps I'll cover that
in a future column.</p>
<p>Similarly, <code>MooseX::Object::Pluggable</code> makes it easy to write classes
that are <em>pluggable</em>, meaning that they can work well with plugins
that define additional methods and attributes.  (Think of a generic
web server or IRC bot object that has individually selectable
additional behaviors.)  Again, I'm just noticing these, and they look
like they are worthy of their own descriptions later.</p>
<p>Also note that <code>Moose</code> is itself built on <code>Class::MOP</code>, which is a
framework for making class frameworks.  Perhaps other projects besides
Moose will be using Class::MOP as a starting point as well.  For
example, the infrastructure of <code>Class::Prototyped</code> (which I use in my
own <code>CGI::Prototype</code>) might be built on <code>Class::MOP</code>, giving it more
flexibility and robustness.</p>
<p>I hope you've enjoyed this two-part introduction to <code>Moose</code>.  Have
fun playing with a production-ready flexible object-building system.  Until next time, enjoy!</p>
