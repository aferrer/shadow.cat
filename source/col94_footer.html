dozen top-selling books on the subject, and over 200 magazine
articles.  Schwartz runs a Perl training and consulting company
(Stonehenge Consulting Services, Inc of Portland, Oregon), and is a
highly sought-after speaker for his masterful stage combination of
technical skill, comedic timing, and crowd rapport. And he's a
